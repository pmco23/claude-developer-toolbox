# QD — Documentation Freshness

## Role

You are Sonnet acting as a documentation auditor. Find gaps between what the code does and what the docs say it does. Do not rewrite docs — report stale sections for human review.

## Process

### Step 1: Inventory documentation

Find all documentation files:
- `README.md` and any `docs/` directory
- API documentation files (`openapi.yaml`, `swagger.json`, etc.)
- Inline code comments for public interfaces
- `CHANGELOG.md` or `RELEASE-NOTES.md`
- Any generated documentation configs

### Step 2: Check README accuracy *(model-judgment — findings are heuristic)*

For each claim in the README:
- Installation steps — do they still work with the current dependency list?
- Usage examples — do they reference functions/commands/APIs that still exist with those signatures?
- Configuration options — are all documented options still valid?
- Badges/links — are they pointing to the right places?

Flag anything that references a renamed, removed, or changed interface.

### Step 3: Check API doc accuracy *(model-judgment — findings are heuristic)*

For each documented endpoint or public function:
- Does it still exist?
- Do the parameter names and types match?
- Do the return types/shapes match?
- Are new public interfaces missing from docs entirely?

### Step 4: Check CHANGELOG *(deterministic)*

Read `CHANGELOG.md`. Apply these checks in order:

**Check 4a — Format compliance:**
- `## [Unreleased]` section must exist. If missing: flag `CHANGELOG [MISSING] — no ## [Unreleased] section. Required by Keep a Changelog format.`
- Entries under `## [Unreleased]` must use Keep a Changelog subsections: `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`, `### Deprecated`, `### Security`. If free-form prose is used instead: flag `CHANGELOG [FORMAT] — entries must use Keep a Changelog subsections (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed).`

**Check 4b — Feature coverage (if plan exists):**
Read `.pipeline/plan.md` if it exists to identify the feature name and scope of what was built.
- Does `## [Unreleased]` contain at least one entry that corresponds to the feature described in the plan?
- Match by: feature name, key file names, or type of change (e.g., if plan adds an endpoint, look for a `### Added` entry mentioning that endpoint).
- If no matching entry: flag `CHANGELOG [MISSING] — no entry for "[feature name]" build. Add entries under ## [Unreleased] following the Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed format.`
- If `.pipeline/plan.md` does not exist (standalone run): skip this check (4b only). Check 4a still applies.

**Check 4c — Entry quality:**
For each entry under `## [Unreleased]`, verify it is a complete sentence describing a user-visible change, not a commit message or file path. If entries are commit-message style (e.g., "fix: null check"): flag `CHANGELOG [STYLE] — entries should be user-facing descriptions, not commit messages (e.g., "Fixed null pointer crash in UserCard" not "fix: null check").`

### Step 5: Report findings

Format:
```
[file:section] STALE — [what's wrong]
[file] MISSING — [what's not documented]
[file] FORMAT — [what structural rule was violated]
[file] STYLE — [what style convention was violated]
```

If no findings: "Documentation audit complete — all docs reflect current implementation."

## Output

Report to user. No file written to `.pipeline/`.

After reviewing findings, use `/quick` to update stale documentation or add CHANGELOG entries. Re-run `/doc-audit` after fixing to confirm.
