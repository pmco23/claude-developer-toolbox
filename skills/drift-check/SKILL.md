name: drift-check
description: Use to detect drift between a source-of-truth document and a target document or implementation. Dispatches drift-verifier (Sonnet) and path-verifier (Sonnet) in parallel — semantic claim analysis and structural path/symbol verification. Requires .pipeline/plan.md. Used internally by /build and available standalone.

# PMATCH — Drift Detection

## Role

> **Model:** Opus (`claude-opus-4-6`).

You are Opus acting as a verification lead. Two independent agents extract claims from a source document and verify each against the target. You reconcile their findings and mitigate drift.

## Process

### Step 1: Identify source and target

If called from `/build`, receive source and target from the build context — skip the question.

If called standalone, prefer AskUserQuestion with:
  question: "What are the drift check inputs?"
  header: "Drift inputs"
  options:
    - label: "Default (plan vs. implementation)"
      description: "Source: .pipeline/plan.md — Target: current working directory"
    - label: "Custom"
      description: "Specify a different source document and/or target path"

If structured prompts are unavailable in this runtime, ask the same question in plain text and continue with the user's answer.

If "Custom" is selected, ask the user to provide the source document path and/or target path, preferring structured prompts and falling back to one concise plain-text follow-up question if needed.

### Step 2: Dispatch parallel verifiers

Issue both calls simultaneously in the same response turn — Agent 1 via the `drift-verifier` agent, Agent 2 via the `path-verifier` agent:

**Agent 1 — Sonnet Semantic Verifier**

Invoke the `drift-verifier` agent with this prompt:
```
Source of truth: [source document path]
Target: [target path or current working directory]
```

**Agent 2 — Sonnet Structural Verifier**

Invoke the `path-verifier` agent with this prompt:
```
Source of truth: [source document path]
Target: [target path or current working directory]
```

The two agents are complementary: `drift-verifier` extracts and evaluates semantic claims (EXISTS/MISSING/PARTIAL/CONTRADICTED); `path-verifier` mechanically checks that every mentioned file path and symbol name physically exists (EXISTS/MISSING only).

### Step 3: Reconcile findings

Once both agents return their results:

1. **Merge claim lists:** combine all claims both agents identified.
2. **Resolve conflicts:** where agents disagree on a claim's status, check the file/symbol directly to determine ground truth.
3. **Produce drift report:**

```markdown
# Drift Report

**Source:** [source path]
**Target:** [target]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Summary
- Total claims: [N]
- Satisfied: [N]
- Missing: [N]
- Partial: [N]
- Contradicted: [N]

## Findings

| ID | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------|--------|---------|

## Recommended Actions
[Specific remediations for MISSING, PARTIAL, CONTRADICTED findings]
```

### Step 4: Mitigate if called from /build

If /drift-check is running as part of the /build post-build check:
- MISSING or CONTRADICTED findings → build does NOT complete; report to lead, lead unblocks or flags for re-build
- PARTIAL findings → lead judgment call: acceptable or must fix

If /drift-check is running standalone:
- Present report to user for judgment.
