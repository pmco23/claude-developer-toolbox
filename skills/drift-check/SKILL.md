name: drift-check
description: Use to detect drift between a source-of-truth document and a target document or implementation. Dispatches Sonnet and Codex in parallel for independent claim extraction and verification. Requires .pipeline/plan.md. Used internally by /build and available standalone.

# PMATCH — Drift Detection

## Role

You are Opus acting as a verification lead. Two independent agents extract claims from a source document and verify each against the target. You reconcile their findings and mitigate drift.

## Process

### Step 1: Identify source and target

Ask the user (or receive from /build context):
- **Source of truth:** what document contains the claims? (default: `.pipeline/plan.md`)
- **Target:** what is being verified against? (default: current implementation in the working directory)

### Step 2: Dispatch parallel verifiers

Issue both calls simultaneously in the same response turn — Agent 1 via the Task tool, Agent 2 via direct `mcp__codex__codex` call:

**Agent 1 — Sonnet Verifier**

Dispatch a subagent with this prompt:
```
You are verifying implementation drift.

Source of truth: [source document path]
Target: [target path or current working directory]

Step 1: Extract all verifiable claims from the source document.
A verifiable claim is a specific, checkable assertion: file paths that should exist, function names that should be implemented, test cases that should pass, acceptance criteria that should be met.

Step 2: For each claim, check whether the target satisfies it:
- EXISTS: the claim is satisfied
- MISSING: the claim is not satisfied — describe what's absent
- PARTIAL: partially satisfied — describe what's missing
- CONTRADICTED: the target actively contradicts the claim

Return a structured list: claim_id, claim, status (EXISTS/MISSING/PARTIAL/CONTRADICTED), evidence.
```

**Agent 2 — Codex Verifier (via Codex MCP)**

**If `mcp__codex__codex` is unavailable** (Codex MCP not connected), dispatch Agent 2 as a Sonnet subagent via the Task tool using the Agent 1 — Sonnet Verifier prompt above. Add `**Note:** Codex MCP unavailable — Agent 2 ran as Sonnet subagent.` immediately after the `**Date:**` line in the drift report.

Call `mcp__codex__codex` directly (do not dispatch a subagent) with:
- `prompt`: the verbatim text inside the fenced code block under "Agent 1 — Sonnet Verifier" above, with `[source document path]` replaced by the source path and `[target path or current working directory]` replaced by the target identified in Step 1
- `approval_policy`: `"never"`

Codex operates independently to surface any claims the Sonnet agent misses.

### Step 3: Reconcile findings

Once both agents return (the Task tool returns Agent 1's output as its result; `mcp__codex__codex` returns Agent 2's output inline as its tool result):

1. **Merge claim lists:** combine all claims both agents identified.
2. **Resolve conflicts:** where agents disagree on a claim's status, check the file/symbol directly to determine ground truth.
3. **Produce drift report:**

```markdown
# Drift Report

**Source:** [source path]
**Target:** [target]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Summary
- Total claims: [N]
- Satisfied: [N]
- Missing: [N]
- Partial: [N]
- Contradicted: [N]

## Findings

| ID | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------|--------|---------|

## Recommended Actions
[Specific remediations for MISSING, PARTIAL, CONTRADICTED findings]
```

### Step 4: Mitigate if called from /build

If /drift-check is running as part of the /build post-build check:
- MISSING or CONTRADICTED findings → build does NOT complete; report to lead, lead unblocks or flags for re-build
- PARTIAL findings → lead judgment call: acceptable or must fix

If /drift-check is running standalone:
- Present report to user for judgment.
