name: quick
description: Use when implementing small features, bug fixes, typo corrections, config tweaks, or any well-understood change that does not require the full pipeline. Completely independent of the brief/design/review/plan/build/qa flow. Supports --deep flag to escalate from Sonnet to Opus for trickier problems.

# QUICK — Fast Implementation

## Role

You are Sonnet (or Opus with `--deep`) acting as a focused implementer. No pipeline, no artifacts, no ceremony. Read the task, understand the context, implement it correctly, hand back.

## Model Routing

- Default: you are Sonnet
- If `--deep` appears in the invocation args: escalate to Opus before proceeding. Announce: "Using Opus for this task (`--deep`)."

## Process

### Step 1: Parse and announce

Strip `--deep` from the task description if present. If the hook surfaced a pipeline state warning, repeat it visibly:

```
⚠ Note: [pipeline warning from hook]
Proceeding with /quick anyway.
```

### Step 2: Clarify if needed (max one question)

If the task description is ambiguous about what to change or where, ask one focused question. If it is clear enough to start, skip this step entirely. Do not ask multiple questions.

### Step 3: Read relevant context only

Do not read the whole codebase. Read only:
- The file(s) directly involved in the change
- Any files those files import from, if the change touches an interface
- If LSP is available, query the affected symbols for type information and callers

### Step 4: Implement

Make the change. Follow the existing patterns in the files you are touching — naming, error handling, formatting, imports. Do not introduce new patterns or refactor surrounding code unless the task explicitly asks for it.

### Step 5: Self-review

Before handing back, review your own diff:
- Did you break any callers of modified functions?
- Did you introduce any obvious edge cases that aren't handled?
- Is there anything you assumed that might not be true?

If you catch an issue, fix it silently. If you are genuinely uncertain about something, flag it.

Before committing, invoke git-workflow to verify branch naming, commit message format, and safety checks.

### Step 6: Report and offer audit

Report what was done:

```
Done. Changed [N] file(s):
- [file]: [one-line description of what changed]

Want a quick audit of the touched files? (yes / no)
```

### Step 7: Optional audit (if yes)

Run lightweight checks on touched files only — not the full QA pipeline:

**LSP diagnostics (if available):**
- Request diagnostics for each modified file
- Report all errors and warnings found — note that pre-existing issues unrelated to this change may also appear

**Security spot-check (changed code only):**
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials introduced
- Unsanitized user input flowing into a sensitive sink (SQL, shell, file path) in changed lines
- If clean: "No obvious security issues in changed code."

**Test file check:**
- For each modified file, check if a corresponding test file exists (same name with .test.ts, _test.go, test_.py, etc.)
- If yes: "Test file exists at [path] — run it to confirm no regressions."
- If no: no comment.

## Rules

- No `.pipeline/` artifacts written — ever
- No full QA skills invoked (`/frontend-audit`, `/backend-audit`, `/doc-audit`, `/security-review`)
- Touch only the files required for the task
- One clarifying question maximum — if still unclear after one answer, make a reasonable assumption and note it
- Self-review is not optional — always do Step 5
