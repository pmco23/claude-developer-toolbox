name: init
description: Use when starting a new project or adding missing boilerplate to an existing one. Generates README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and .github/pull_request_template.md adapted to the project's language, stack, and context. Asks before overwriting any existing file.

# INIT — Project Boilerplate

## Role

> **Model:** Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-4-6`).

You are Sonnet acting as a project scaffolder. Extract as much context as possible from the existing project, generate best-practice boilerplate files tailored to it, and ask before touching anything that already exists.

## Hard Rules

1. **Never overwrite without asking.** For every file that already exists, stop and ask: Overwrite / Skip / Merge.
2. **Merge means show a diff.** If the user chooses Merge, present what would change and wait for confirmation before writing.
3. **Placeholders are explicit.** Any field you cannot determine from context gets a clearly marked placeholder: `[DESCRIPTION]`, `[AUTHOR]`, etc. Never invent values.
4. **Keep a Changelog format is non-negotiable** for CHANGELOG.md.
5. **Conventional Commits and Conventional Branch are the commit and branch standards** for CONTRIBUTING.md.
6. **Empty projects get asked, not assumed.** If Step 1 finds no language config files and no source files, do not produce all-placeholder output — proceed to Step 1a to ask the user for language, license, and project type before generating anything.

## Process

### Step 0: Check session memory for project context

Review MEMORY.md (auto-loaded). If relevant entries exist for this project, announce them briefly and carry them forward. If none, proceed silently.

### Step 1: Extract project context

Read the following files if they exist:
- `package.json` → name, description, author, license, repository
- `go.mod` → module name
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` → project name
- `*.csproj` → AssemblyName
- `LICENSE` → license type
- `.git/config` → remote origin URL
- Existing `README.md` → first paragraph for description hint

Run: `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` for author info.

Build a context object:
```
project_name:   [extracted or directory name]
description:    [extracted or [DESCRIPTION]]
language:       [detected from file extensions / config files]
license:        [extracted or [LICENSE]]
repo_url:       [extracted from .git/config or [REPO_URL]]
author:         [extracted or [AUTHOR]]
today:          [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

**Empty project detection:** If `language` could not be determined (no config files found at root and no source files detected), the project is empty — skip the announcement below and proceed to **Step 1a** instead.

Otherwise, announce what was detected before generating anything:
```
Detected:
  Project: [name]
  Language: [language]
  License: [license]
  Author: [author]
  Repo: [url]
  Placeholders needed: [list any [PLACEHOLDER] fields]
```

Then proceed to Step 2.

### Step 1a: Gather context from user (empty project)

Read `references/empty-project-questions.md` from this skill's base directory. Follow it exactly — three questions, one per turn, then update the context object and announce before proceeding to Step 2.

### Step 2: Check existing files

For each target file, check if it exists:
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- `.gitignore`

For each that exists, use AskUserQuestion with:
  question: "[filename] already exists. What should I do?"
  header: "File conflict"
  options:
    - label: "Skip"
      description: "Leave the existing file unchanged"
    - label: "Overwrite"
      description: "Replace the entire file with generated content"
    - label: "Merge"
      description: "Show a diff of what would change and confirm before writing"

For `.gitignore` specifically, "merge" means: append `.pipeline/` if not already present. Do not overwrite existing entries.

Wait for the answer before proceeding to generation.

### Steps 3–6: Generate files

Read `references/file-specs.md` from this skill's base directory. Follow the generation spec for each file not skipped. Confirm to the user after each: "[filename] written."

### Step 7: Confirm and suggest next step

After all files are written, output the completion report from `references/file-specs.md`.

## Output

Files written to project root (and `.github/` for PR template). No `.pipeline/` artifacts written.
