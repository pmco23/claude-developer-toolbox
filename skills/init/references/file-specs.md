# File Generation Specs

For each file not skipped in Step 2, generate content appropriate for the detected project. Apply these constraints:

---

## CLAUDE.md

Project-level instruction file for Claude Code. Two sections:

### Section 1: Project Conventions

Extract from detected context. Use `[PLACEHOLDER]` for anything not determinable.

```markdown
# Project Conventions

Language: [detected language/stack]
Test command: [detected or [TEST_COMMAND]]
Lint command: [detected or [LINT_COMMAND]]
Build command: [detected or [BUILD_COMMAND]]
```

Detection rules for commands:
- **Node/TS:** `npm test` / `npm run lint` / `npm run build` (check `scripts` in `package.json`)
- **Go:** `go test ./...` / `golangci-lint run` / `go build ./...`
- **Python:** `pytest` / `ruff check .` or `flake8` / (none by default)
- **C#/.NET:** `dotnet test` / `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` / `dotnet build`
- **Rust:** `cargo test` / `cargo clippy` / `cargo build`
- If a `Makefile` exists, prefer `make test` / `make lint` / `make build` if those targets are defined

If the project has additional conventions visible in existing config files (e.g., `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json`, `rustfmt.toml`), add a brief note: `Style config: [filename]`.

### Section 2: Git Conventions

Always include this section:

```markdown
# Git Conventions

Branching: Conventional Branch — `<type>/<short-description>` (feat, fix, hotfix, chore, release)
Commits: Conventional Commits — `<type>[scope][!]: <description>` (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, ci, build, perf)
Merge strategy: squash-merge to main
Protected branches: never push directly to main or master — use a PR
```

Specs: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [Conventional Branch](https://conventional-branch.github.io/)

### Section 3: Plugin Configuration

Always include this section with flags commented out:

```markdown
# Plugin Configuration (claude-developer-toolbox)
# Uncomment a flag to enable it.
# tdd: disabled
# session-end-pack: disabled
```

### Merge behavior

If CLAUDE.md already exists and user chose "Merge": append the **Git Conventions** and **Plugin Configuration** sections if not already present. Do not modify existing content.

---

## README.md

- Sections: project name, description, installation (language-appropriate command), usage, contributing, license
- Installation command must match detected language (npm install / go get / pip install / dotnet restore / [INSTALL_COMMAND])
- Use `[PLACEHOLDER]` for any field that cannot be detected from project context — never invent values

## CHANGELOG.md

- Must follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format exactly
- Must follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
- Include `## [Unreleased]` section and an initial `## [0.1.0] - [today]` entry with `### Added\n- Initial release`

## CONTRIBUTING.md

- Branching: [Conventional Branch](https://conventional-branch.github.io/) — `<type>/<short-description>`, types: feat/feature/fix/bugfix/hotfix/chore/release
- Commits: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) — `<type>[scope]: <description>`
- PR process: branch from main, PR against main, fill PR template, request review
- Development setup: adapt to detected language/stack, or use `[SETUP_STEPS]` placeholder

## .github/pull_request_template.md

- Sections: Description, Type of Change (checklist), Testing (checklist), Verification Evidence, Checklist (branch name, commit format, CHANGELOG, docs)
- Type of Change checkboxes: Bug fix, New feature, Breaking change, Documentation, Refactor, Chore
- Testing checkboxes: Tests added/updated, All tests pass, Manual testing

## .gitignore

- If creating new: include `.pipeline/` (pipeline artifacts are session-specific and must not be version-controlled) plus any language-appropriate entries (e.g., `node_modules/`, `*.pyc`, `dist/`, `*.o`)
- If merging into existing: append `.pipeline/` only if not already present

## Completion Report

After all files are written, output:

```
Boilerplate generated:
  ✓ CLAUDE.md   (project conventions + git conventions + plugin config flags)
  ✓ README.md
  ✓ CHANGELOG.md
  ✓ CONTRIBUTING.md
  ✓ .github/pull_request_template.md
  ✓ .gitignore  (.pipeline/ excluded from version control)
  [skipped: list any skipped files]

Placeholders to fill in: [list any [PLACEHOLDER] fields remaining]

Git conventions (Conventional Commits, Conventional Branch) are now in CLAUDE.md and will be followed automatically.

To start developing a new feature on this project, run /brief to crystallize requirements into a pipeline brief.
