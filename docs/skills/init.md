# /init — Project Boilerplate

**Gate:** None (always available)
**Writes:** `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`
**Model:** Sonnet

Scaffolds best-practice project boilerplate adapted to the current project. Extracts context from `package.json`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `*.csproj`, `.git/config`, and existing files. Falls back to clearly marked placeholders (`[DESCRIPTION]`, `[AUTHOR]`, etc.) for anything it can't detect.

Asks before touching any file that already exists: **Overwrite / Skip / Merge**. Merge shows a diff before writing.

## Usage

```
/init
```
