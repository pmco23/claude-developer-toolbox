# Hooks Reference

This plugin registers six hook events backed by eight command hooks. They are
passive infrastructure — none require user action. They run automatically as
Claude Code fires lifecycle events.

---

## SessionStart — `session-start-check.sh`, `scripts/session-context.js`

**When it fires:** Once, at the start of every Claude Code session.

**What it does:** Runs two lightweight startup checks:

1. `session-start-check.sh` checks that the external tools the plugin depends on
   are installed. If any are missing it prints a warning to stderr and lists
   which tools are absent. The session starts regardless — hooks fail open.
2. `scripts/session-context.js` looks for `.claude/session-log.md` in the
   current project. If present, it prints the last 3 session summaries with a
   short header so Claude can inject them as system context.

The startup hook also keeps `~/.claude/statusline.js` aligned with this
plugin's `hooks/statusline.js`, but only when no statusline exists yet or the
current file is already a symlink managed by this plugin. It will not overwrite
a custom statusline or another plugin's statusline.

**Tools checked:**

| Tool | Used by |
|------|---------|
| `jq` | JSON parsing in `pipeline-gate.sh` and `context-monitor.sh` (primary) |
| `python3` | JSON parsing fallback when `jq` is absent |
| `repomix` | `/pack` and `/qa` codebase snapshots |

**Fail-open:** Missing tools degrade specific features but never block the session.

**Session history behavior:**
- History lives at `.claude/session-log.md` inside each project
- Only the last 3 entries are injected at startup to bound token cost
- If `.gitignore` exists but does not ignore `.claude/session-log.md`, the
  script prints a one-time reminder to stderr and records that the notice was shown

## UserPromptSubmit — `pipeline-gate.sh`

**When it fires:** Before Claude processes a submitted prompt.

**What it does:** Enforces the phase ordering of the development pipeline for slash-command
skills. It reads the submitted prompt, extracts the first slash command, walks up the directory
tree to find the nearest `.pipeline/` directory, and checks whether the required artifact for
that skill exists. If the artifact is missing, it returns a JSON block decision with the exact
next step. If the command is `/quick` or a gating artifact looks stale, it injects
`additionalContext` so Claude can surface the warning in its reply.

**Gate table:**

| Skill invoked | Required artifact | Block message |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| `/design` | `.pipeline/brief.md` | Run `/brief` first |
| `/review` | `.pipeline/design.md` | Run `/design` first |
| `/plan` | `.pipeline/design.approved` | Run `/review` until all findings resolve |
| `/build`, `/drift-check` | `.pipeline/plan.md` | Run `/plan` first |
| `/cleanup`, `/frontend-audit`, `/backend-audit`, `/doc-audit`, `/security-review`, `/qa` | `.pipeline/build.complete` | Run `/build` then `/drift-check` first |
| `/quick` | — | Never blocked; warns if a pipeline is active |

Slash commands not in this table (e.g. `/status`, `/pack`, `/init`, `/git-workflow`) are always
allowed. Non-slash prompts are ignored. Commands (`/commit`, `/push`, `/commit-push-pr`,
`/sync`, `/clean-branches`, `/release`) also bypass the gate because `pipeline-gate.sh`
explicitly ignores them.

**Walk-up search:** The gate searches from the current directory upward, so it works correctly
from any subdirectory of a project.

## PreToolUse — `convention-guard.sh`

**When it fires:** Before every `Write` or `Edit` tool call.

**What it does:** Enforces project conventions by inspecting the target file path:

| Rule | Trigger | Action | Message |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| `.claude-plugin/` guard | Write/Edit to `.claude-plugin/*` (non-manifest) | `permissionDecision: "deny"` | Only manifests belong in `.claude-plugin/` |
| Hook chmod reminder | Write/Edit to `hooks/*.sh` | `systemMessage` reminder | Remember: `chmod +x`, correct shebang, run `test-gate.sh` |
| Version sync reminder | Write/Edit to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` or `marketplace.json` | `systemMessage` reminder | Also bump the paired manifest version |

Returns supported JSON:
- `permissionDecision: "deny"` for blocked writes into `.claude-plugin/`
- `systemMessage` reminders for hook script edits and manifest version sync

---

## PostToolUse — `context-monitor.sh`

**When it fires:** After every tool call.

**What it does:** Reads a bridge file written by `statusline.js` at
`/tmp/claude-ctx-<session_id>.json` and injects a context warning via JSON `additionalContext`
if the context window is running low. The bridge file is ignored if it is more than 60 seconds
old (stale statusline data is silently skipped).

**Warning thresholds:**

| Usage | Message |
|-------|---------|
| ≥ 95% | `💀 Context critical — /compact now` |
| ≥ 81% | `⚠ Context at N% — /compact recommended` |
| ≥ 63% | `⚠ Context at N% — consider /compact soon` |

Below 63% the hook exits silently.

---

## PreCompact — `compact-prep.sh`

**When it fires:** Before Claude Code compacts the conversation.

**What it does:** Injects the current pipeline state as JSON `additionalContext` so the
compacted summary preserves it. Without this, compaction could discard awareness of which
pipeline phase is active and which artifacts exist.

**Output (example):**

```
=== Pipeline State ===
Artifacts present: brief.md design.md design.approved plan.md
Stage: build-ready
Repomix snapshots: code (45KB), docs (13KB), full (98KB) (verify age before reuse)
```

If no `.pipeline/` directory exists, or the directory is empty, the hook exits silently.

---

## SessionEnd — `session-end-pack.sh`, `scripts/session-summary.js`

**When it fires:** When a Claude Code session ends.

**What it does:** Runs two end-of-session tasks:

1. `session-end-pack.sh` generates three targeted Repomix snapshots (code,
   docs, full) into the `.pipeline/` directory. Each `repomix` call is guarded
   by a 60-second timeout (fail-open if the `timeout` command is absent). If at
   least one snapshot succeeds, it writes a `repomix-pack.json` manifest with
   the available variants, timestamps, and file sizes.
2. `scripts/session-summary.js` appends a compact summary of the session to
   `.claude/session-log.md`. It uses local heuristics only: first user message
   for the goal, file-edit tool calls for key changes, assistant phrasing for
   decisions, and the last assistant message for open threads.

**Skip conditions:** exits silently when:
- `repomix` is not installed
- no active `.pipeline/` project is found
- `CLAUDE.md` contains `session-end-pack: disabled`

**Opt-out:** Add `session-end-pack: disabled` to your project's CLAUDE.md.

**Session summary behavior:**
- summaries are markdown digests, not raw transcript dumps
- each entry is appended to `.claude/session-log.md`
- the log is trimmed from the top when it exceeds 50KB
- the script exits 0 on empty input, malformed input, or missing transcript data

## Shared Libraries — `hooks/lib/`

Hooks share common logic via two sourceable library files in `hooks/lib/`. These files have no
shebang and are not executable — they are loaded with `source`.

### `hooks/lib/find-project.sh`

| Function | Returns | Failure |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `find_pipeline_dir` | `.pipeline` dir | Falls back to `$PWD/.pipeline` |
| `find_pipeline_dir_strict` | `.pipeline` dir | Returns 1 |
| `find_project_root` | Parent of `.pipeline` | Returns 1 |
| `find_file_up <name>` | File path | Returns 1 |

All functions respect `PIPELINE_TEST_DIR` for test compatibility.

### `hooks/lib/json-helpers.sh`

| Function | Input | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `_json_stdin_field <dotted.path>` | stdin | Extract field from JSON on stdin |
| `_json_file_field <file> <field> [default]` | file | Extract field from JSON file |
| `_json_quote <value>` | string | Emit a safely quoted JSON string |
| `_emit_block_decision <reason>` | string | Emit a `UserPromptSubmit` block decision |
| `_emit_system_message <message>` | string | Emit a hook `systemMessage` |
| `_emit_additional_context <event> <context>` | strings | Emit hook `additionalContext` |
| `_emit_pretool_permission <decision> <reason>` | strings | Emit `PreToolUse` permission control |

Prefers `jq`, falls back to `python3`. Supports nested fields via dot notation.
